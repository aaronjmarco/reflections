What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it adds a .git hidden folder to the directory. this file tracks changes in each commit.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the working directory is any files that you are working on in the directory. the staging area is the in between place 
where you begin to add files to the repository for a commit. the repository tracks changes to files at each commit that are in it.
the staging area tells you where everything is. you may not want to track a file in the repository that is in the directory.
it let's you know if the files are going to be tracked.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

i can see which files i'm going to commit using "git status" command. i can use "git diff" to see what changes i've made to the code.
